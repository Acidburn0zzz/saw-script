This script 'ecdsa.saw' in this directory performs a proof of
equivalence between the Java ECDSA implementation contained in
'ecdsa.jar' and the Cryptol specification in cryptol-spec.

To run it, edit run.sh to point to the correct location of 'classes.jar'
or 'rt.jar' on your machine. Then do:

    ./run.sh

Alternatively, edit the Makefile with the same '.jar' file location, and
run:

    make build
    make verify
