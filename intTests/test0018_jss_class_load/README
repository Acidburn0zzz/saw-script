Test class loading in JSS and SAWScript.

Test that JSS can quickly find classes via the classpath, both in '.'
and non-'.' components. Test that SAW starts up quickly when '/' is in
the classpath.

As mentioned in https://github.com/GaloisInc/jvm-verifier/issues/3,
JSS, and hence the SAWScript interpreter, were loading all '.class'
files located at or below any classpath directory on startup. The
default classpath is the current directory '.', so e.g. starting 'saw'
in the root directory '/' made it appear to hang when the classpath
was unset, since it was searching the entire filesystem for '.class'
files.
